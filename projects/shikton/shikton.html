        The project I worked on is a web application built with React JS as the
        frontend framework, Strapi as the backend CMS, and Stripe as the payment
        gateway.
      </p>

      <p class="project-desc">
        The application is styled using Sass, a CSS preprocessor that provides a
        more efficient and flexible way to write CSS. The backend of the
        application is deployed on Render.com, a cloud platform that simplifies
        the deployment process with a user-friendly interface. The frontend is
        deployed on Firebase, a scalable and secure platform for web and mobile
        applications.
      </p>

      <p class="project-desc">
        The application allows users to create an account, browse through a list
        of products, and purchase them using Stripe as the payment method. The
        products are managed through Strapi, which provides an easy-to-use
        interface for content creation and management. The user interface is
        designed to be responsive, accessible, and user-friendly, with a clean
        and modern design.
      </p>
      <p class="project-desc">
        The application also includes features such as user authentication, cart
        management, and order tracking. Overall, this project demonstrates the
        use of modern web development technologies to build a scalable, secure,
        and functional web application that provides a seamless user experience.
